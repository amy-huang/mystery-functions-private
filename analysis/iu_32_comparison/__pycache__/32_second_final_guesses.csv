SumParityInt,jidehen,returns the inputs sum mod 2
SumParityInt,jtarlows,"1 if the sum is odd, 0 if sum is even"
SumParityInt,bsilverm,I think it sums the numbers in the list and outputs 1 if the sum is odd and 0 if the sum is even
SumParityInt,sduraide,Starts with even and ends with odd
SumParityInt,vkalev,"If the sum is even, return 0. If the sum is odd, return 1."
SumParityInt,ojohnso3,"0 if sum of set is even, 1 if odd
"
SumParityInt,rgupta33,"If the list contains an odd number of odd numbers, return 1. Else return 0. "
SumParityInt,nnguye20,"If the sum of the integers in the list is even, return 0. Else, return 1."
SumParityInt,nrshaida,It has something to do with a true or false condition are returns an int representation of that evaluation. It has to do with the last number and relates to the middle contents. 
SumParityInt,sbawabe,if the last digit of the last number is odd?? i know this isn't right but im stuck
SumParityInt,nparekh1,"It size = 1, it returns 1 if the number is odd and 0 if number is even. else, it returns 1 if the numbers are a mix of odd and even and 0 if they are consistently odd/even"
SumParityInt,jgraves1,Sums the numbers and then does mod 2
SumParityInt,ading6,"0 if numbers in the set sum to even
1 if numbers sum to odd"
SumParityInt,jzhang30,"if(sum(list)%2 == 0) return 0
else return 1;"
SumParityInt,cchrabas,"I think it returns 1 if the sum of the numbers in the list is odd, and 0 otherwise."
SumParityInt,yyang149,"it evaluates the length of the array; if len(arr)%4 = 1 or 2, it evaluates to 1, else 0"
SumParityInt,mtavukcu,"The function returns 1 as long as there is an odd number of odd integers in the array. Otherwise, it returns 0."
SumParityInt,mkimurat,"I think the function only outputs 1s and 0s. I think it outputs 1 if the sum of the numbers in the list is odd, otherwise it outputs 0."
SumParityInt,akim112,input % 2 
SumParityInt,,"Returns 0 if the sum of all the numbers is even, 1 if it's odd."
SumParityInt,ysayin,"It is a function that checks whether the sum of the input numbers are odd or even
